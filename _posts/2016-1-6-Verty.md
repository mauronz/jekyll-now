title: Unpacking Verty
---

In this post we will see the various steps required to obtain the malicious payload, starting from the js script that works as a dropper.

## Javascript downloader

The sample is an obfuscated Javascript script. Specifically, all variables have random names and all the strings of the main function are XOR-encrypted with a static key.
After the deobfuscation, we can see that it is a simple downloader:

The executable **verty.exe** is stored as an exe file with temporary name in the user profile directory and then executed.

## Executable

verty.exe is a 32-bit Windows GUI executable. Performing a static analysis does not provide any strong indicator of malicious activity. The only interesting piece of information is the large .rsrc section, which may indicate that the program unpacks its malicious code at runtime.

Being this a GUI program, trying to reverse engineering from IDA is a huge waste of time, so our best shot is to move to dynamic analysis.
If our hypothesis of the program unpacking its malicious payload at runtime is correct, we should be able to spot, at some point during the execution, an interesting memory region, i.e. a region with execution permissions. 

In order to verify our hypothesis, we can run the program and then attach to it our favorite debugger (in my case Immunity Debugger).

And there it is, a region of size 0x28000 with RWE permissions. At this point we can dump it and see if there is anything valuable (hopefully some code).

### Shellcode

#### First stage

The dumped data contains position-independent code. The first operation it performs is the retrieval of the library functions it needs: this is done by looping through the export tables of the modules that are already loaded by the cutable (namely _kernel32.dll_, _ntdll.dll_ and _advapi32.dll_). For every entry in the table it computes a hash of the function name, which is then compared to the hardcoded ones. Finally the addresses of functions the are stored in an array for later use.  Here we can see the initial part of the shellcode:

The purpose of this shellcode is just to load a second stage of position-independent code inside the same memory region and then to execute it.

#### Second stage

The second stage performs the same operations of the previous one to get the addresses of the library functions (but this time there are more). This is the final "unpacking" stage of the malware: it overwrites completely the original executable in memory with a new malicious PE file. The core of the second stage is at the end:

A new thread is created and its routine is just a stub that jumps to the entry point of the newly loaded executable (which is passed in the thread data).

At this point the final operation to perform is the dump of the memory regions that were previously occupied by the original executable: the unpacked file, according to [Virustotal](https://virustotal.com/en/file/348c8889917d267701b950a1c6b8c45083a1f7d96aa7e828e1ea161ffcb2bef4/analysis/) is a variant of the Graftor trojan.
