What about me? I'm a computer engineer with a great interest in IT sec. Ranging from exploit development to malware analysis, I am always looking for something new to tease my curiosity.

Main programming languages: C, Java, Python, assembly (x32/x64)

[Here]({{ site.baseurl }}/cv.pdf) is my CV if anyone is interested. I am currently looking for a job in infosec.
